# Steplore – Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ is intended for official public communication and provides both functional and technical clarity about how Steplore works.

---

# General

### What is Steplore?

Steplore is a Chrome browser extension that records real browser workflows and automatically converts them into structured documentation.

It generates:

- Step-by-step guides  
- Screenshots per action  
- AI-written titles and descriptions  
- Optional AI-generated videos with voice-over narration  

Steplore transforms execution into reusable knowledge.

---

### Who is Steplore built for?

Steplore is designed for:

- Product Teams  
- Support Teams  
- Operations  
- HR & Training  
- QA Engineers  
- Technical Writers  

It is especially valuable for organizations working with web-based products that require clear, repeatable documentation.

---

### What problem does Steplore solve?

Traditional documentation requires:

- Manual screenshots  
- Screen recording tools  
- Video editing  
- Writing structured descriptions  
- Formatting and organizing content  

This often takes 2–4 hours per guide.

Steplore reduces that process to minutes by automating capture and content generation.

# How It Works

### How does Steplore recording work?

1. Install the Chrome extension  
2. Click the Steplore icon  
3. Enter a short description of your guide  
4. Click **Start Recording**  
5. Perform your workflow  
6. Click **Stop**

Steplore then processes the session and generates a complete guide automatically.

---

### What does Steplore capture?

During an active recording session, Steplore captures:

- Click interactions  
- Navigation changes  
- UI state transitions  
- Screenshots of the browser view  

Recording only happens after explicit user initiation.

---

### Does Steplore record continuously in the background?

No.

Recording starts only when the user clicks **Start Recording** and stops immediately when **Stop** is clicked. There is no passive or background recording.
