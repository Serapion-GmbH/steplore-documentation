# Welcome to StepLore

The main idea of the project is to create a web application that can automatically generate video and documentation
based on the user's demo while using another application.

The user will be able to start the documentation creation process, then switch to their application and perform the
actions for which they want to generate documentation or a demo.

The application will be able to create Confluence documentation, a PowerPoint presentation, a PDF, or just HTML.
Additionally, the user will receive a video demo.
